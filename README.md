# Harmful-Brain-Activity-Classification-using-data-fusion-and-deep-learning-ensemble-models
In this project, EEG images and spectrogram images are used as input data. Preprocessing includes transformations and noise reduction techniques such as band-pass filtering, wavelet denoising, and normalization. After preprocessing, both modalities are merged, and features are extracted and refined using feature selection methods to retain the most informative attributes. Five deep learning models—EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, and MobileNetV2—are trained, and their outputs are combined using a voting ensemble strategy to achieve robust and accurate harmful brain activity classification.
